Painless Dagger and Android UI testing

Project is designed as an MVP to experiment with combination of several Android technologies (Activity, Fragment, Dagger, ViewModel, Async, UI testing) that are historically challenging to integrate. Demonstrate the following:

- DI utilizing minimal Dagger config. No dagger-android
- Instrumented and JVM testing using androidx.test
- Activity, Fragment, ViewModel and async Service
